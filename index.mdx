# What is PolyPulseBets?

PolyPulseBets is the largest prediction market on PulseChain, allowing you to stay informed and profit from your knowledge by betting on future events across various topics.

Studies show prediction markets are often more accurate than pundits because they combine news, polls, and expert opinions into a single value that represents the market’s view of an event’s odds. Our markets reflect **accurate, unbiased, and real-time probabilities** for the events that matter most to you. Markets seek truth.

## Quick Overview

On PolyPulseBets, you can **buy shares** representing future event outcomes (i.e. “Will PulseChain flip Ethereum in transaction volume this year?”).

* Shares in event outcomes are **always priced** between **$0.00 and $1.00**, and every pair of event outcomes (i.e. each pair of “YES” + “NO” shares) is fully collateralized by **$1.00** (in USDT or USDC).
* Shares are created when opposing sides come to an agreement on odds, such that the sum of what each side is willing to pay is equal to $1.00.
* The shares representing the **correct, final outcome** are paid out **$1.00** each upon market resolution.

Unlike sportsbooks, you are not betting against “the house” – the counterparty to each trade is another PolyPulseBets user. As such, there is no “house” to ban you for winning too much.

<Note>
**Note on Trading:** In the current V1 version, positions are **locked until the event resolves**. The ability to sell shares before the deadline to lock in profits or cut losses is a planned feature for **V2**.

## Understanding Prices

**Prices = Probabilities.**

Prices (odds) on PolyPulseBets represent the current probability of an event occurring. For example, in a market predicting whether **PLS will hit $0.0002**, if YES shares are trading at **18 cents**, it indicates an **18% chance** of that outcome happening.

These odds are determined by what price other users are currently willing to buy those shares at. Just like stock exchanges don’t “set” the prices of stocks, PolyPulseBets does not set prices / odds — they’re a function of supply & demand on the automated market maker (AMM).

## Making money on markets

In the example above, if you believe the chance of PLS hitting that price is **higher than 18%**, you would buy “Yes” shares at 18 cents each. 

* If it happens, each “Yes” share becomes worth **$1.00**, resulting in an **82-cent profit per share**.
* Conversely, any trader who owned “No” shares would see their investment become worthless once the market resolves.

## How accurate are the odds?

Research shows prediction markets are often more accurate than experts, polls, and pundits. Traders aggregate news, polls, and expert opinions, making informed trades. Their economic incentives ensure market prices adjust to reflect true odds as more knowledgeable participants join.

This makes prediction markets the best source of real-time event probabilities. People use PolyPulseBets for the most accurate odds, gaining the ability to make informed decisions about the future.

If you’re an expert on a certain topic, PolyPulseBets is your opportunity to profit from trading based on your knowledge, while improving the market’s accuracy.
