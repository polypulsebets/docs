# What is PolyPulseBets?

PolyPulseBets is the premier prediction market on **PulseChain**, allowing you to stay informed and profit from your knowledge by betting on future events across crypto, politics, sports, and more.

Studies show prediction markets are often **more accurate than experts** because they combine news, polls, and opinions into a single value that represents the market’s true view. Our markets reflect accurate, unbiased, and real-time probabilities for the events that matter most.

## Quick Overview

On PolyPulseBets, you trade **shares** representing future event outcomes (e.g., *“Will PulseChain flip Ethereum in transaction volume?”*).

* **Binary Outcomes:** Shares are always priced between **$0.00 and $1.00**.
* **Fully Collateralized:** Every pair of "YES" + "NO" shares is backed by **$1.00** in stablecoins.
* **Fair Pricing:** Odds are set by supply and demand via an Automated Market Maker (AMM)—not by a centralized house.
* **Winning Payout:** If your outcome occurs, each share pays out **$1.00**. Losing shares expire at $0.00.

Unlike sportsbooks, you are not betting against "the house." You are trading against other users. There is **no limit** to how much you can win.

<Note>
  **🚀 New in V2: Sell Early!**
  
  You no longer have to wait for an event to finish. You can now **Sell** your positions at any time before the deadline to lock in profits or stop your losses.
</Note>

## Understanding Prices

**Prices = Probabilities.**

The price of a share reflects the market's estimated probability of that event happening.

> **Example:**
> If "YES" shares for *PLS hitting $0.0002* are trading at **18 cents**, the market believes there is an **18% chance** of that event occurring.

If you believe the true probability is **higher** than 18%, buying "YES" is a winning strategy.

## How to Make Money

Using the example above (YES @ $0.18):

1.  **Buy:** You purchase 1,000 "YES" shares for **$180**.
2.  **Win:** If PLS hits the target, your shares redeem for **$1,000** ($1.00 per share).
3.  **Profit:** Your net profit is **$820** (a 455% return).

*Alternatively, if the price rises to 40 cents on the news, you can sell early for a guaranteed 2x profit.*

## Oracle & Resolution

Trust is our priority. To ensure markets resolve fairly during our launch phase, PolyPulseBets utilizes a transparent **Mock Oracle** system.

### 🛡️ Current System
* **Assertion:** An admin or validator asserts the final outcome based on public data.
* **Dispute Window:** A time-locked window allows users to challenge incorrect outcomes.
* **Settlement:** If no dispute occurs, the market resolves and pays out winners.

### 🔮 Future Roadmap
We are committed to full decentralization. As soon as a battle-tested decentralized oracle (such as **UMA** or **Chainlink**) is live on PulseChain, the protocol will upgrade to that system, making PolyPulseBets fully immutable and unstoppable.

## Why use PolyPulseBets?

By trading on PolyPulseBets, you aren't just betting—you are helping to uncover the truth. Traders are financially incentivized to be correct, meaning our markets often react to news faster than major media outlets.

**Don't just watch the news. Trade it.**
