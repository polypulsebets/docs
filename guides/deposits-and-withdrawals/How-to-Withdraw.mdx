# Withdrawing Funds

Since PolyPulseBets is non-custodial, "withdrawing" simply means moving funds from your wallet to a bank or exchange to convert to cash.

## Option A: Direct Off-Ramp (Recommended)

Some services allow you to sell PulseChain assets directly for fiat currency (USD, EUR, GBP) without needing to bridge to another network first.

- [**0xCoast:**](https://0xcoast.com) \* Connects directly to US Bank Accounts.
  - Allows you to sell **USDC** (PulseChain) or **PLS** directly for USD.

## Option B: Bridge to Ethereum / Exchange

If you prefer to use a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bridge to Ethereum">
    Go to the [**PulseBridge**](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/) and bridge your **USDC** from PulseChain back to **Ethereum**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to Exchange">
    Once the funds arrive in your wallet on the Ethereum network, send them to your exchange's **USDC (ERC-20)** deposit address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cash Out">
    Sell the USDC for USD/EUR on the exchange and withdraw to your bank account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Gas Fee Reminder**

  Always keep a small amount of **PLS** in your wallet. You will need it to pay for the gas fees to send or bridge your winnings out. **Never swap 100% of your PLS!**
