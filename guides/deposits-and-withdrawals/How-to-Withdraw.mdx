# Withdrawing Funds

Since PolyPulseBets is non-custodial, "withdrawing" simply means moving funds from your wallet to a bank or exchange to convert to cash.

## Option A: Reverse Bridge (To ETH/Exchange)
1.  Go to the [PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/).
2.  Bridge your **USDC** or **PLS** from PulseChain back to **Ethereum**.
3.  Once on Ethereum, send the funds to your Coinbase/Binance deposit address.
4.  Sell for USD/EUR and withdraw to your bank.

## Option B: Direct Off-Ramp
Some services allow you to sell **PLS** directly for fiat.
* **0xCoast:** Off-ramp stablecoins directly to a US Bank Account.
* **Guardarian:** Sell crypto directly to a Visa/Mastercard.

<Note>
**Always keep some PLS:** You need a small amount of PLS to pay for the gas fees to send or bridge your winnings out. Don't swap 100% of your PLS!
