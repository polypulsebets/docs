# Deposit from a Centralized Exchange

Most major exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken) do **not** yet natively support the PulseChain network. To get funds from an exchange to PolyPulseBets, you typically need to withdraw to Ethereum and then bridge.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy USDC or ETH">
    Purchase **USDC** (USD Coin) or **ETH** (Ethereum) on your preferred exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Withdraw to Wallet">
    Withdraw the funds to your self-custodial wallet address (e.g., MetaMask or Rabby).
    * **Network:** Select **Ethereum (ERC-20)**.
    * **Address:** Paste your public wallet address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bridge to PulseChain">
    Once the funds are in your wallet on the Ethereum network:
    1.  Go to the **[Official PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/)**.
    2.  Connect your wallet.
    3.  Select your asset (USDC or ETH) and bridge it from Ethereum to **PulseChain**.
    4.  Switch your wallet network to PulseChain to see your funds arrive.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Critical Warning**
  
  **Do NOT** withdraw directly to PulseChain unless the exchange explicitly lists "PulseChain" as a network option. Doing so on an unsupported network (like BSC or Polygon) may result in the permanent loss of your funds.
</Warning>
