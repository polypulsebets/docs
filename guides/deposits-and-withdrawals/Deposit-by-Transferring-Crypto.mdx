# How do I Transfer Crypto?

Transferring crypto is the simplest way to fund your account if you already hold assets in a self-custodial wallet.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Address">
    Open your crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby) and copy your **public wallet address**. Since PolyPulseBets is decentralized, you deposit simply by holding funds in your own wallet address on the PulseChain network.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Network">
    Ensure your wallet is set to the **PulseChain** network. Sending funds to the wrong network (like Ethereum or BSC) without bridging first may result in them not being visible.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Funds">
    From your external wallet or exchange, withdraw or send the supported tokens to your address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Wait for the transaction to confirm (usually less than 10 seconds on PulseChain). Your balance will update automatically on PolyPulseBets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Critical Safety**
  
  Always double-check that you are sending funds on the **PulseChain Network**. Sending non-supported tokens or using the wrong network may cause an irrecoverable loss.
</Warning>

## Supported Tokens & Chains

PolyPulseBets operates exclusively on **PulseChain**.

| Asset | Symbol | Supported Network | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **USD Coin** | USDC | PulseChain | **Primary betting currency** |
| **Pulse** | PLS | PulseChain | Gas fees |

<Note>
  **Need to Bridge?**
  
  If your funds are on Ethereum, Arbitrum, or Solana, you must use the **[PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/)** or an exchange to move them to PulseChain first.
