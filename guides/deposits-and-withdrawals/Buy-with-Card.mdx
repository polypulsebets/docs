# Buy Crypto with Card

You can bypass exchanges and bridges by using "On-Ramp" services that allow you to buy PulseChain assets directly with fiat currency (USD, EUR, GBP).

## Supported Providers
We recommend the following services that natively support **PulseChain (PLS)**:

* **[Guardarian](https://guardarian.com)**
* **[Coast](https://0xcoast.com)** (Direct bank onboarding)
* **[PortalX](https://portalxswap.io)** (Aggregator)

## How to Buy
1.  Visit one of the providers above.
2.  Select **PLS (PulseChain)** as the asset to buy.
3.  Enter the amount of Fiat currency you want to spend.
4.  Enter your **PolyPulseBets wallet address** as the recipient.
5.  Complete the checkout with your Visa or Mastercard.
6.  The PLS will arrive directly in your wallet on PulseChain.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Once you have PLS, use [PulseX](https://app.pulsex.com/swap) to swap some of it for **USDC** to start betting.
