# Buy Crypto with Card

You can bypass centralized exchanges and bridges by using "On-Ramp" services. These allow you to buy PulseChain assets directly with fiat currency (USD, EUR, GBP) using a card or bank transfer.

## Supported Providers

We exclusively recommend the following services for their native PulseChain support and reliability:

* **[0xCoast](https://0xcoast.com)** (Direct bank/card onboarding)
* **[Internet Money](https://internetmoney.io)** (Wallet with built-in buy feature)

## How to Buy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Provider">
    Visit **0xCoast** or open the **Internet Money Wallet**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Asset">
    Choose **USDC** (PulseChain) as the asset to buy. 
    * *Note: You will also need a small amount of **PLS** to pay for gas fees. If you can't buy USDC directly, you can buy PLS and swap it later.*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Input the amount of fiat currency (e.g., $100 USD) you wish to spend.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recipient Address">
    Enter your **PolyPulseBets wallet address** as the recipient (if not using the Internet Money wallet directly).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Checkout">
    Complete the payment process with your Visa, Mastercard, or Bank Transfer. The funds will arrive directly in your wallet on PulseChain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**
  
  If you bought **PLS** instead of USDC, simply go to **[PulseX](https://app.pulsex.com/swap)** and swap your PLS for **USDC** to start betting.
