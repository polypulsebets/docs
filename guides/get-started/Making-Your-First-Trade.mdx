## Managing Your Position

Once you are in a trade, you have two options:

### Option 1: Hold to Resolution
If you are confident in your prediction, you can hold your shares until the event ends.
* **Win:** If you are correct, you can claim **$1.00** per share.
* **Lose:** If you are incorrect, the shares expire at $0.00.

### Option 2: Sell Early (V2 Feature)
You do not have to wait for the event to finish.
* **Lock in Profits:** If your side is winning and the price goes up, you can sell your shares early to secure a guaranteed profit.
* **Cut Losses:** If the market turns against you, you can sell your remaining position to recover some capital.

<Note>
  **Pro Tip:**
  
  Check your **Portfolio** tab at any time to see the current value of your positions and how much they have moved since you bought them.
