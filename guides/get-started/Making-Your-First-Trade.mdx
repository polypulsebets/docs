# Walkthrough

Once you’ve **signed up** and **deposited funds**, you’re ready to start trading on PolyPulseBets. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Market">
    Visit the **Markets Feed** to see all available questions. You can use the **Search bar**, **Category filters** (Crypto, Politics, etc.), or **Sort** (Volume, Newest) to find a topic you know about.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Your Side">
    Click on a market to open the detailed view. Analyze the chart and odds.
    * Select the outcome you believe will win (e.g., **Trump** or **Harris**, **YES** or **NO**).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    In the trade box, enter the amount of **USDC** you want to bet. The UI will verify you have enough funds and enough **PLS** for gas.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Trade">
    Click **Confirm**. Your wallet will ask you to approve the transaction. Once confirmed on PulseChain, you own the shares!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Position

Simple, right? Once you are in a trade, you can track it easily.

* **Check Portfolio:** Go to the "Portfolio" tab to see all your active bets and their current value.
* **Await Resolution:** Once the event occurs and the market resolves, if you picked the winner, you can claim your winnings (1.00 USDC per share).

<Note>
**Note on Trading:** In the current V1 version, positions are **locked until the event resolves**. The ability to sell shares before the deadline to lock in profits or cut losses is a planned feature for **V2**.
