# Prices = Probability

The price of a share represents the market's collective belief in the probability of that outcome.

* **Price: $0.75** = **75% Probability**
* **Price: $0.25** = **25% Probability**

## The AMM (Automated Market Maker)
We use a **Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM)** to determine the odds.
* When you buy **YES**, you add USDC to the pool and take YES shares.
* This makes YES shares scarcer, automatically pushing the price **UP**.
* Simultaneously, NO shares become more abundant relative to the pool, pushing their price **DOWN**.

This mechanism ensures that the price always reflects the real-time balance of supply and demand.

<Note>
**V1 Trading Note:** In the current version, **selling shares back to the AMM is disabled**. Once you purchase a position, you must hold it until the market resolves. If you win, your shares redeem for $1.00. If you lose, they expire worthless.
