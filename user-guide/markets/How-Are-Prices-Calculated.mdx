# Automated Market Maker (AMM)

PolyPulseBets does not use a traditional "order book" where you have to wait for someone to match your bet. Instead, we use an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**.

## Supply and Demand
The price of a share represents the **probability** of that outcome occurring, ranging from **$0.00** (0%) to **$1.00** (100%).

* **Buying YES:** When you buy "YES" shares, you are adding USDC to the "YES" pool. This increases the price of YES and decreases the price of NO.
* **Selling YES:** When you sell shares back to the pool, the price of YES goes down.

## The Math
The protocol ensures that the price of **YES + NO** always equals **$1.00**.
If *YES* is trading at **$0.60**, *NO* will automatically trade at **$0.40**.

## Slippage
Because prices move based on how much is bought or sold:
* **Small Trades:** Have little impact on the price.
* **Large Trades:** Can move the price significantly (slippage). The UI will always show you your "Average Entry Price" before you confirm a trade.
