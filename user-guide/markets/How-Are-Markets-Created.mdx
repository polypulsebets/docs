# Market Creation Process

To ensure high-quality questions and unambiguous resolution criteria, PolyPulseBets currently operates on a **curated model** with community input.

## 1. Suggesting a Market
Any user with a connected wallet can suggest a new market topic.
1.  Navigate to the **Suggest** tab (or button in the navbar).
2.  Fill out the suggestion form with your question (e.g., *"Will Bitcoin hit $100k in 2025?"*).
3.  Submit your idea.

## 2. Review & Approval
Our team of market curators reviews suggestions daily. We look for:
* **Clarity:** Can the outcome be proven true or false definitively?
* **Interest:** Is there sufficient trading volume and public interest?
* **Resolution Source:** Is there a reliable public source (e.g., Binance price feed, AP News, Official Government stats) to verify the outcome?

## 3. Deployment
Once approved, an Administrator deploys the market smart contract.
* **Initial Liquidity:** The protocol often seeds the initial liquidity (e.g., $1,000) to allow trading to start immediately.
* **Rules Set:** Specific "Resolution Rules" are attached to the market to cover edge cases.

## Decentralization Roadmap
In future versions (V5), we plan to introduce **Permissionless Creation**, allowing users to deploy their own markets by burning a PLS fee and providing their own initial liquidity.
