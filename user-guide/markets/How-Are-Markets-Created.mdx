# Market Creation

Markets on PolyPulseBets are designed to be unambiguous and resolvable.

## The Creation Process

1.  **Drafting:** A market is proposed with a specific question (e.g., *"Will Bitcoin trade above $100k on Jan 1st?"*).
2.  **Rules & Source:** Every market must have a defined **Resolution Source** (e.g., Binance API, AP News) and explicit rules for edge cases.
3.  **Funding:** The initial liquidity is seeded into the Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool to allow trading to begin immediately.
4.  **Live:** Once deployed to PulseChain, the market is open for trading until the **Resolution Date**.

## Can I create a market?

Currently, market creation is **curated** by the PolyPulseBets team to ensure quality, safety, and unambiguous resolution criteria. We do not support permissionless creation to prevent spam and confusing markets.

### Suggest a Market
We highly encourage community input! If you have a great idea for a market, you can submit it directly:

1.  **Use the Button:** Click the **"Suggest"** button located on the main website interface.
2.  **Email Us:** Send your idea and a proposed resolution source to **hello@polypulsebets.com**.

If the market is viable, the team will deploy it and provide the initial liquidity.
