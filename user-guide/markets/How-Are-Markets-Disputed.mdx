# Disputes

If a bad actor tries to resolve a market incorrectly (e.g., saying "YES" won when "NO" actually won), the **Dispute Mechanism** protects users.

## The Dispute Process (UMA)
1.  **Challenge:** Any user can challenge an incorrect resolution by posting a **Dispute Bond** (in PLS or UMA tokens).
2.  **Voting:** The dispute is sent to **UMA Tokenholders** (the decentralized Oracle). They vote on what the correct outcome actually was.
3.  **Ruling:** The outcome with the majority of votes becomes the final truth.
4.  **Reward:** The person who disputed correctly **earns the bond** posted by the bad actor. This economic incentive ensures markets remain honest without centralized control.
