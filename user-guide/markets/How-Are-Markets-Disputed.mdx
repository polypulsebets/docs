# The Dispute Mechanism

PolyPulseBets is designed to be trust-minimized. Even though an Oracle asserts the outcome, **you** have the power to challenge it if they lie or make a mistake.

## When to Dispute
You should only initiate a dispute if the **Asserted Outcome** is demonstrably false according to the **Resolution Rules**.

## How to Dispute
If you see an incorrect assertion during the **Challenge Period**:

1.  **Go to the Market Page:** You will see a "Dispute" status.
2.  **Post Bond:** You must stake a specific amount of tokens (e.g., **50 USDC**) as a "Dispute Bond".
3.  **Provide Evidence:** You must submit a link (URL) proving why the assertion is wrong.
4.  **Confirm:** Once confirmed, the resolution timer **stops**.

## What happens next?
The market enters a **"Disputed"** state.
1.  The case is escalated to a higher-tier arbitration mechanism (currently a multi-sig council of trusted community members; in V3, the UMA DVM).
2.  Arbitrators review the evidence and the Rules.
3.  **Final Ruling:**
    * **If you were right:** You get your Bond back **plus a reward**, and the market is corrected.
    * **If you were wrong:** You lose your Bond (it is burned or paid to the Oracle), and the original result stands.
