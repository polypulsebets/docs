# Resolution Rules

Real life is messy. Sometimes events don't happen exactly as predicted. To prevent ambiguity, every market on PolyPulseBets comes with a **Rules** section.

## Where to find Rules
On every Market Page, scroll down to the **"📜 Resolution Rules"** box located just below the trading chart.

## Common Clauses
These rules define exactly how the Oracle will interpret edge cases.

* **Date Extensions:** *"If the game is postponed but played within 48 hours, the market remains valid. Otherwise, it resolves to 50/50."*
* **Source of Truth:** *"Resolution will be determined by the closing price on Binance.com at 12:00 UTC."*
* **Specific Definitions:** *"For the purpose of this market, 'Elon Musk stepping down' includes appointing a new CEO, even if he remains on the board."*

<Warning>
  **Read Before Trading**
  
  Always check the Rules section. The smart contract resolves based on these written rules, not necessarily "common sense" or Twitter rumors.
