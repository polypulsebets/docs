# Market Clarifications

Sometimes, real-world events are messy. A "Clarification" is an official update to the market rules to resolve ambiguity **before** the market closes.

## When does this happen?
* **Example:** A market asks *"Who will win the election?"* but one candidate dies before the election.
* **Action:** A clarification might be issued stating: *"If a candidate withdraws or passes away, bets on them will resolve to NO."*

## The Rule of "Spirit of the Market"
If a specific edge case is not covered in the rules, the market resolves according to the **"Spirit of the Market"**—what a reasonable person would interpret the question to mean at the time of creation. We strive to avoid "gotcha" resolutions based on technicalities.
