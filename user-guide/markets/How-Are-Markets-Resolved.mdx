# Market Resolution Lifecycle

When a market reaches its deadline (e.g., "Dec 31, 2025"), trading stops, and the market enters the **Resolution Phase**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expiration">
    The deadline passes. No new positions can be opened. The market status changes to **"Awaiting Assertion"**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assertion">
    An Oracle (currently a protocol admin or validator) reviews the real-world outcome and "Asserts" the winner (YES or NO).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Challenge Period">
    A timer starts (typically 2 hours). During this window, the assertion is **publicly visible** but not final.

    - If the assertion is correct, nothing happens.
    - If the assertion is wrong (e.g., Oracle said "YES" but Trump actually lost), users can **Dispute** it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Once the timer expires without a dispute, the market is **Resolved**.

    - **Winners:** YES shares become redeemable for **\$1.00**.
    - **Losers:** NO shares become worth **\$0.00**.
  </Step>
