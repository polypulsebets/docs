# Contacting Support

We know that navigating decentralized protocols can sometimes be confusing. We have established several channels to ensure you get the help you need.

## 1. The Support Center (Recommended)
The fastest way to get help is to visit the **Support** tab inside the PolyPulseBets dApp.
* **Go to:** `https://polypulsebets.com/support`
* Here you can find quick answers, check the status of services, and access direct links to our community channels.

## 2. Community Discord
Join our Discord server to chat with other traders and get real-time assistance from community moderators.
* **[Join Discord](#)**
* *Note: Admins will NEVER ask for your seed phrase or private key. If someone DMs you asking for this, block them immediately.*

## 3. Email Support
For business inquiries, partnership proposals, or critical bug reports that require privacy, you can email us directly.
* **Email:** `hello@polypulsebets.com`
