# Your Keys, Your Crypto

Unlike a standard email/password account, PolyPulseBets uses **Web3 Login**.

* **We do not have your private key.** It exists only in your wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.).
* **Exporting:** To export your key or seed phrase, you must do so **inside your wallet extension settings**, not on our website.
