# Skin in the Game

Polls ask people what they _hope_ will happen. Prediction markets ask people what they think will happen and backs it up with money.

- **Honesty:** Money incentivizes participants to tell the truth about their expectations, rather than signaling virtue.
- **Speed:** Markets react instantly to breaking news, whereas polls take days to conduct and publish.
- **Accuracy:** Historically, prediction markets have outperformed polls in predicting election outcomes and economic events.
