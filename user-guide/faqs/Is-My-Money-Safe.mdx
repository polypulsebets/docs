# Security Model

PolyPulseBets is a **Non-Custodial** platform.

1. **You Hold the Keys:** We never take possession of your funds. Your USDC stays in your wallet until you approve a trade.
2. **Smart Contracts:** When you trade, funds are sent to a smart contract on PulseChain. This contract is immutable and governs the payout. We cannot "steal" the funds from the contract.
3. **Oracle Resolution:** Payouts are determined by the Optimistic Oracle, not by the PolyPulseBets team directly. This prevents manipulation.

<Note>
  **Smart Contract Risk:** As with all DeFi applications, there is always a non-zero risk of smart contract bugs. Never trade money you cannot afford to lose.
