# Security & Custody

PolyPulseBets is a **Non-Custodial** protocol. This means we (the developers) never hold your funds.

## Where is my money?
* **In Your Wallet:** When you are not in a trade, your USDC and PLS sit in your personal crypto wallet. We cannot touch them.
* **In the Contract:** When you place a bet, your funds are sent to the Market Smart Contract. This contract is programmed to hold the funds securely until the market resolves.

## Is the Protocol Solvent?
**Yes.** PolyPulseBets is fully collateralized.
* Every single "YES" share + "NO" share pair is backed by exactly **$1.00 USDC** in the contract vault.
* It is mathematically impossible for the "House" to run out of money to pay winners, because the money to pay you is locked in the contract the moment the shares are minted.

## Risks
While the math is secure, all DeFi protocols carry risks:
* **Smart Contract Risk:** Unforeseen bugs in the code could potentially be exploited.
* **Oracle Risk:** If the Oracle (Judge) is compromised or malicious, they could resolve a market incorrectly. (See [Dispute Mechanism](/markets/how-are-markets-disputed) for how we mitigate this).

<Warning>
  **Experimental Software**
  
  PolyPulseBets is experimental software running on PulseChain. Never bet more than you can afford to lose.
