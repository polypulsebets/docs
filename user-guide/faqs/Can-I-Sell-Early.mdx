# Can I Sell My Position?

**Not in V1.**

In the current launch version of PolyPulseBets, trading is **"Buy and Hold"**. Once you purchase shares in an outcome (e.g., YES), you must hold them until the market resolves.

* **If you win:** You redeem your shares for $1.00 each.
* **If you lose:** Your shares expire worth $0.00.

## Why?
We are using a Parimutuel-style locking mechanism for V1 to ensure maximum stability and simplicity. **Selling positions early to lock in profits is a planned feature for V2.**
