# Yes, You Can Sell Early!

One of the most powerful features of PolyPulseBets (V2) is the ability to trade in and out of positions dynamically. You do **not** have to wait until the market resolves to realize a profit.

## Why Sell Early?
* **Lock in Profits:** If you bought "YES" at **20¢** and it rises to **80¢**, you can sell immediately to secure a **4x return** without risking a last-minute reversal.
* **Cut Losses:** If news comes out that hurts your prediction, you can sell your shares to recover a portion of your capital instead of losing it all.

## How to Sell
1.  Go to the Market Page where you hold a position.
2.  Switch the tab from **"BUY"** to **"SELL"**.
3.  Enter the amount of shares you wish to sell (or use the slider to sell 100%).
4.  Click **"Confirm Sell"**. The protocol will swap your shares back into **USDC** instantly.

  **Liquidity Note**
  
  Selling requires available liquidity in the pool. In very low-volume markets, you may experience "slippage" (getting a slightly lower price) if you try to sell a large position all at once.
