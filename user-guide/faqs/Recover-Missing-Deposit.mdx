# Missing Deposit?

If you sent funds but don't see them, check these common issues:

## 1. Wrong Network
Did you send funds on **Ethereum** instead of **PulseChain**?
* **Solution:** You must bridge them. Use the [PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/) to move the assets from Ethereum to PulseChain.

## 2. Wrong Token
Did you send **USDT** instead of **USDC**?
* **Solution:** Check your wallet balance for USDT. You may need to swap it for USDC on [PulseX](https://app.pulsex.com/swap) before the UI recognizes it for betting.

## 3. Custom Token Import
Your wallet might not be displaying the token.
* **Solution:** Import the official PulseChain USDC contract address into your wallet settings.
