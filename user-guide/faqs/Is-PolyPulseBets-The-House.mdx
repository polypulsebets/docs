# No House Edge

PolyPulseBets is **not** a casino or a sportsbook. There is no "House" betting against you.

* **Peer-to-Peer-to-Pool:** You are trading against an Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool that is funded by liquidity providers and other traders.
* **Fair Odds:** The odds are determined solely by supply and demand (what other people are betting), not by an oddsmaker trying to beat you.
* **Winners Paid by Losers:** The money won by correct predictors comes directly from the capital put in by incorrect predictors.
