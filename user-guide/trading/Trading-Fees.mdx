# Fee Structure

PolyPulseBets strives to keep trading costs transparent to ensure the sustainability of the protocol.

## 1. Platform Fee
A standard fee (e.g., **2%**) is applied to every trade.
* This fee goes to the protocol treasury to fund development, server costs, and market curation.
* It is automatically deducted from the output amount of your trade.

## 2. Liquidity Provider (LP) Fee
A small fee (typically **1%**) is paid to the liquidity pool.
* This incentivizes the liquidity providers who back the markets with USDC.

## 3. Gas Fees (PulseChain)
Because PolyPulseBets runs on **PulseChain**, you must pay a "Gas Fee" in **PLS** for every transaction.
* **Cost:** Typically less than $0.01 per trade.
* **Speed:** Transactions usually confirm in < 3 seconds.

<Note>
**No Hidden Fees:** We do not charge withdrawal fees or deposit fees. You only pay standard network gas.
