# Fee Structure

PolyPulseBets strives to keep trading costs transparent to ensure the sustainability of the protocol.

## 1. Platform Fee
A standard fee (currently **2%**) is applied to every trade.
* This fee goes to the protocol treasury to fund ongoing development, server costs, and market curation.
* It is automatically deducted from the output amount of your trade, so the "Potential Return" you see is always net of fees.

## 2. Liquidity Provider (LP) Fee
A small fee (typically **1%**) is paid directly to the liquidity pool.
* This fee incentivizes the liquidity providers (LPs) who back the markets with USDC, ensuring there is always capital available for you to trade against.

## 3. Gas Fees (PulseChain)
Because PolyPulseBets runs on **PulseChain**, you must pay a "Gas Fee" in **PLS** for every transaction (Approve, Buy, Sell, Claim).
* **Cost:** Typically less than **$0.01** per trade.
* **Speed:** Transactions usually confirm in **< 3 seconds**.

<Note>
  **No Hidden Fees**
  
  We do not charge "withdrawal fees" or "deposit fees". You only pay standard network gas fees when moving funds.
