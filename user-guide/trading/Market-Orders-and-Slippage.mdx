# Order Types

PolyPulseBets V1 exclusively uses **Market Orders**.

## What is a Market Order?
When you click "Buy", your trade is executed **instantly** at the best available price currently offered by the liquidity pool (AMM).
* **Pros:** Guaranteed execution.
* **Cons:** The price can move slightly while your transaction is processing.

## What is an AMM?
Even though you are only buying, we use an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** to calculate the odds.
* The AMM balances the pool of **YES** and **NO** shares.
* As more people buy **YES**, the AMM automatically raises the price of YES and lowers the price of NO.

## Understanding Slippage
Because prices are calculated dynamically, large trades can shift the price *during* the transaction. This is called **Price Impact** or **Slippage**.

* **Small Trade ($10):** Minimal impact. You buy at $0.50.
* **Huge Trade ($10,000):** High impact. You might push the price to $0.60, receiving fewer shares for your money.

<Warning>
**Slippage Warning:** The UI will warn you if your trade size is too large for the current liquidity. Always check the **"Price Impact"** percentage before confirming a large bet.
