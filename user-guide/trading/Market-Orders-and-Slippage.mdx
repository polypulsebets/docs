# Order Types

PolyPulseBets currently operates exclusively using **Market Orders**.

## What is a Market Order?
When you click **"Buy"** or **"Sell"**, your trade is executed **instantly** at the best available price currently offered by the liquidity pool.
* **Pros:** Guaranteed execution. You don't have to wait for a counterparty.
* **Cons:** The price can move slightly while your transaction is processing (Slippage).

## How the AMM Works
We use an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** to calculate odds and facilitate trading.
* **Balancing Act:** The AMM holds a pool of **YES** and **NO** shares + **USDC**.
* **Automatic Pricing:** As more people buy **YES**, the AMM automatically raises the price of YES and lowers the price of NO to maintain balance.
* **Always Liquid:** Unlike an order book where you need a buyer for every seller, the AMM is always willing to trade with you (as long as there is liquidity in the pool).

## Understanding Slippage
Because prices are calculated dynamically based on supply and demand, **Large Trades** can shift the price *during* the transaction. This phenomenon is called **Price Impact** or **Slippage**.

* **Small Trade ($10):** Minimal impact. You buy at the displayed price (e.g., $0.50).
* **Huge Trade ($10,000):** High impact. Your buy pressure might push the price up to $0.60, meaning you receive slightly fewer shares for your money than expected.

  **Slippage Warning**
  
  The UI will automatically calculate and warn you if your trade size is too large for the current liquidity. 
  
  **Rule of Thumb:** Always check the **"Price Impact"** percentage before confirming a large bet. If it is high (>2%), consider splitting your trade into smaller chunks.
