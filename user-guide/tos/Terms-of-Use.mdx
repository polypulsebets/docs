# PolyPulseBets Terms of Use

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

## Introduction

These Terms of Use provide the terms and conditions under which you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you” or “your”), are permitted to use, interact with or otherwise access the open-source software, smart contracts, and interfaces known as **[PolyPulseBets]** (“the Protocol,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

**PolyPulseBets is a decentralized, open-source protocol.** It is **not** operated by a registered business entity, corporation, or limited liability company. It is developed and deployed by independent, pseudonymous developers (the "Developers").

These Terms of Use, together with any documents and additional terms or policies that are appended hereto or that expressly incorporate these Terms of Use by reference (collectively, the “Terms”), constitute a binding agreement between you and the Developers.

These Terms are applicable to:
(i) all content and informational functionality available on **PolyPulseBets.com** (the “Site”) and any other interface to which the Terms are posted; and
(ii) the blockchain-based smart contract protocol (the “Protocol”) deployed on the **PulseChain** blockchain.

**NOTICE: PLEASE REVIEW THE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING, INTERACTING WITH OR USING THE SITE OR THE PROTOCOL (INCLUDING BY CONNECTING YOUR WALLET), YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, INCLUDING THE WAIVER OF LIABILITY AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER BELOW.**

## 2. The Protocol & "AS-IS" Nature

### No Legal Entity
You acknowledge that PolyPulseBets is **experimental, open-source software**. It is not a bank, brokerage, investment firm, or financial institution. There is no corporate entity (LLC, Corp, etc.) managing the Protocol. The Protocol runs autonomously on the PulseChain blockchain.

### Non-Custodial
The Developers **do not** have custody of your funds at any time. When you interact with the Protocol, you are sending cryptoassets directly to a smart contract. We cannot reverse transactions, recover lost funds, or access your wallet.

### No Guarantees
The Site and Protocol are provided on an **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"** basis. The Developers make no representations or warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, regarding the Protocol, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

As a condition to accessing the Protocol, you represent and warrant that:

1.  **Not a Restricted Person.** You are not located in, or a citizen of, any Restricted Jurisdiction listed in Section 1.
2.  **Sophistication.** You possess sufficient knowledge of blockchain technology, PulseChain, and smart contracts to understand the risks.
3.  **Risk of Loss.** You acknowledge that prediction markets are speculative. **YOU MAY LOSE 100% OF YOUR FUNDS.** You agree that the Developers are not responsible for your financial losses.
4.  **Oracle Resolution.** You acknowledge that market outcomes are determined by the **UMA Optimistic Oracle** or the specific resolution mechanism defined in the smart contract. You agree to accept these on-chain results as final.

* ORACLE FAILURES OR INCORRECT MARKET RESOLUTIONS.
* LOSS OF PRIVATE KEYS OR WALLET ACCESS.

You explicitly waive any right to pursue legal action, harassment, or claims for damages against any specific Judge, Oracle, or Arbitrator for their role in resolving a market. Errors in judgment or interpretation of rules by The Judge are part of the game mechanics and are not grounds for liability. **You cannot blame the Judge.**

**Maximum Liability**
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE DEVELOPERS EXCEED **$100 USD**.
