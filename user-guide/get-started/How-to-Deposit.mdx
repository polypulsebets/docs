## About PulseChain & Stablecoins

PolyPulseBets operates on the **PulseChain** network. To trade, you generally need:
1.  **USDC** (on PulseChain) to place bets.
2.  **PLS** (on PulseChain) to pay for small gas fees.

## Method 1: Swap on PulseX (Recommended)

If you already have tokens on PulseChain (like PLS, HEX, INC, or DAI), the easiest way to get betting funds is to swap them.

1.  Go to [PulseX](https://app.pulsex.com/swap).
2.  Connect your wallet.
3.  Swap your existing tokens for **USDC**.
4.  Return to PolyPulseBets and start trading immediately.

## Method 2: On-Ramp Services (Buy with Card)

If you are new to crypto or PulseChain, you can often buy **PLS** directly using a credit card or bank transfer via third-party on-ramp providers.

* **Coast:** Allows you to onboard directly from your bank account to PulseChain.
* **Kanga Exchange:** Supports direct fiat-to-crypto on-ramps.
* **SafeTrade:** A centralized exchange where you can deposit other crypto and trade for PLS.

Once you have acquired PLS via these services, send it to your wallet and use **Method 1 (PulseX)** to swap some of it for **USDC**.

## Method 3: Bridge from Ethereum

If you have funds on the Ethereum mainnet (like ETH, DAI, or USDC), you can bridge them over.

1.  Visit the [Official PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/).
2.  Connect your wallet on the Ethereum network.
3.  Select the asset you want to move (e.g., USDC).
4.  Approve and Bridge.
5.  Wait for the funds to arrive on PulseChain (this can take 15-30 minutes).

<Warning>
**Important:** Ensure you are always interacting with the correct official bridge URL to avoid phishing scams.
