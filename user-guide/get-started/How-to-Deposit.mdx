## About PulseChain & Stablecoins

PolyPulseBets operates on the **PulseChain** network. To trade effectively, you will generally need:

1.  **USDC** (on PulseChain) to place bets and collateralize positions.
2.  **PLS** (on PulseChain) to pay for small gas fees (transaction costs).

## Method 1: Swap on PulseX (Recommended)

If you already hold tokens on the PulseChain network (like PLS, HEX, INC, or DAI), the fastest way to get betting funds is to swap them.

1.  Go to **[PulseX](https://app.pulsex.com/swap)**.
2.  Connect your wallet.
3.  Select the token you want to sell and swap it for **USDC**.
4.  Return to PolyPulseBets and your balance will update immediately.

## Method 2: On-Ramp Services (Buy with Card)

If you are new to crypto or PulseChain, you can often buy **USDC** or **PLS** directly using a credit card or bank transfer via these trusted providers:

* **0xCoast:** A direct on/off-ramp that allows you to move funds between your bank account and PulseChain easily.
* **Internet Money:** A user-friendly wallet and service that supports buying crypto directly.

*Once you have acquired funds via these services, ensure you have **USDC** in your wallet to start trading.*

## Method 3: Bridge from Ethereum

If you have funds on the Ethereum mainnet (like ETH or USDC), you can bridge them over to PulseChain.

1.  Visit the **[Official PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/)**.
2.  Connect your wallet on the **Ethereum** network.
3.  Select **USDC** to move across.
4.  Approve and Bridge the funds.
5.  Wait for the funds to arrive on PulseChain (typically 15-30 minutes).
