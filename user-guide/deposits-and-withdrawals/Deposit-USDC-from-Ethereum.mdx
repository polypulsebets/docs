# Deposit USDC (Ethereum)

If you hold **USDC** on the Ethereum mainnet, you cannot send it directly to your PolyPulseBets wallet address without bridging first. Sending it directly will result in the funds remaining on the Ethereum network, invisible to our PulseChain dApp.

## The Bridging Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to PulseBridge">
    Navigate to the [Official PulseBridge](https://bridge.pulsechain.com/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and ensure you are on the **Ethereum Mainnet**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select USDC">
    Select **USDC** from the token list. Enter the amount you wish to deposit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve & Send">
    Click **Send**. You will need to pay an Ethereum gas fee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Arrival">
    Bridging typically takes **15-30 minutes**. Once complete, switch your wallet network to **PulseChain** to see your funds available for betting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Token Address:** On PulseChain, bridged USDC is often wrapped. Ensure you import the correct token address to your wallet to see your balance.
