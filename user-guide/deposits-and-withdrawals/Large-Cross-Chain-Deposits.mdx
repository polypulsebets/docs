# Large Deposits

For users depositing large amounts ($10k+), standard bridges can sometimes be slow or liquidity-constrained. We recommend using **Cross-Chain Aggregators** to minimize slippage and ensure the best rates.

## Recommended Aggregators

These platforms scan multiple bridges and DEXs to find the most efficient route for your swap.

* **[PortalX](https://portalxswap.io)**: Excellent for moving from Bitcoin, Solana, or Base directly to PulseChain.
* **[SparkSwap](https://sparkswap.xyz)**: Deep liquidity for converting large amounts of BSC (BNB) or Ethereum assets into PulseChain stablecoins.
* **[ChangeNOW](https://changenow.io)**: Non-custodial swapping service that supports large volume transfers to PulseChain (PLS) without connecting a wallet.

<Tip>
**Slippage Warning:** When moving large amounts, always check the "Price Impact" or "Minimum Received" before confirming. Splitting a very large transaction into two smaller ones can sometimes save on fees.
