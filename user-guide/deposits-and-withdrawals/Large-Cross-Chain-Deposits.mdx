# Large Deposits

For users depositing large amounts (**$10k+**), standard bridges can sometimes be slow or liquidity-constrained. We recommend using **Cross-Chain Aggregators** to minimize slippage and ensure the best rates.

## Recommended Aggregators

These platforms scan multiple bridges and DEXs to find the most efficient route for your swap.

* **[PortalX](https://portalxswap.io)**
  * Best for moving assets from **Bitcoin**, **Solana**, or **Base** directly to PulseChain.
  * Aggregates liquidity from multiple sources to reduce price impact.

* **[SparkSwap](https://sparkswap.xyz)**
  * Deep liquidity for converting large amounts of **BSC (BNB)** or **Ethereum** assets into PulseChain stablecoins.
  * Often provides faster bridging times for specific pairs.

* **[ChangeNOW](https://changenow.io)**
  * A non-custodial swapping service that supports large volume transfers to PulseChain (PLS) without needing to connect a wallet.
  * Ideal for users who prefer a simple "send-to-address" interface.

<Tip>
  **Slippage Warning**
  
  When moving large amounts, always check the **"Price Impact"** or **"Minimum Received"** value before confirming. 
  
  *Strategy:* If the price impact is high (>1%), consider splitting a very large transaction into two or three smaller ones to save on fees and get a better average rate.
